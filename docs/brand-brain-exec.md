## CORE POSITIONING

### One-Liner
When how you show up catches up to who you've become.

### Brand Promise
I help executives and professionals align their presence across wardrobe, voice, and digital platforms so they lead with coherence and authority.

### Who This Is For
Mid-career executives, founders, attorneys, consultants, and professionals who've built credibility but feel their image lags behind their growth. They're ready to close the gap between who they are and how they're perceived.

### What Makes Us Different
Most executive stylists stop at clothes. Most brand consultants skip the visual. I bridge both: creative intelligence from fashion meets strategic clarity from brand psychology. The result is presence that holds from the boardroom to LinkedIn.

## VOICE + TONE GUIDE

### Brand Voice Characteristics
- **Grounded:** Direct sentences. Clear ideas. No hype.
- **Intelligent:** Strategic, editorial, confident without ego.
- **Calm Authority:** Guiding, not performing. Reassuring without coddling.
- **Style-Forward:** Visual sophistication without pretension.

### Language Rules
‚úÖ Use:
- Short declarative sentences
- Active verbs (align, refine, design, build)
- Sensory + emotional language (feels, lands, shifts)
- Practical benefits grounded in outcomes

‚ùå Avoid:
- "It's not X, it's Y" constructions
- "You're not just X, you're Y"
- Em dashes
- Overused online terms (elevate, level up, unlock)
- Fluff or excess modifiers

### Tone Examples
**Good:**
"You've built something real. Now your presence needs to reflect that."
"Leadership is perception. Let's design what they see."
"Everything speaks: your blazer, your bio, your bearing."

**Avoid:**
"You're not just a leader‚Äîyou're a visionary ready to elevate your brand and unlock your potential."
