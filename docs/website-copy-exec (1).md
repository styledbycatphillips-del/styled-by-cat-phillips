### Section 1: The Problem (Mirror)

**Heading:**  
When Your Image Lags Behind Your Growth

You've evolved. Your responsibilities have expanded. Your authority has deepened.

But your wardrobe still references 2018. Your LinkedIn bio sounds like someone else wrote it. Your presence feels fragmented across platforms.

The gap between who you are and how you're seen costs you opportunities, credibility, and energy.

---

### Section 2: The Transformation (Movement)

**Heading:**  
What Changes When Presence Aligns

Imagine walking into a room and feeling like your clothes, your confidence, and your credibility speak the same language.

Your wardrobe reflects your role. Your voice carries authority without performance. Your digital presence works as hard as you do.

People see you the way you've already become.

### Section 3: How It Works

**Heading:**  
The Process

**Discovery**

**Design**  
We rebuild your visual and verbal identity. Wardrobe strategy, messaging refinement, and platform alignment.

**Delivery**  
You walk away with a cohesive presence system: from your closet to your LinkedIn profile.

### Section 4: About Cat (Brief)

**Heading:**  
Why Kirksey House

I've spent over a decade merging aesthetics with identity. From styling clients behind the chair to building brand strategies for professionals, I understand that presence is perception.

Most stylists stop at clothes. Most brand consultants ignore the visual. I bridge both.

The result: executives and professionals who show up with coherence and lead with authority.

## ABOUT PAGE

### Headline  
From Chair to Brand: Building Presence for Professionals

### Body Copy

I started as a creative stylist in 2014. Over the years, I noticed something: the clients who felt most confident weren't just dressed well. They aligned how they looked with how they sounded and where they showed up.

That insight became my work.

Today, I help executives, attorneys, consultants, and founders build cohesive presence across wardrobe, voice, and digital platforms. I combine creative intelligence from fashion with strategic clarity from brand psychology.

Most people hire a stylist for their closet or a consultant for their messaging. I do both because presence doesn't fragment. Everything speaks: your blazer, your bio, your bearing.

My approach is grounded, strategic, and designed for professionals who've outgrown their image and need a system that grows with them.
